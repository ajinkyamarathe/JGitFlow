# crud-service
A simple RESTful CRUD service to serve as a starting point or an example of Spring MVC + Maven projects.

Simply clone this repository to your system and then do a Maven build with the tomcat:run goal. You will then have the service running at http://localhost:8080/CRUD

You will also need to run a mongodb server in order to test the CRUD operations.
